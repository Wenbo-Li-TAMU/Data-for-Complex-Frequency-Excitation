## Contents

- **`simulation.zip`**  
  MATLAB scripts and related files used to generate the numerical simulation
  results reported in the paper.  
  These files reproduce the frequency-response curves, effective quality factor
  calculations, and other simulated data shown in the figures.

- **`Experiment_part_1.zip`**  
  Experimental data analysis scripts and raw/processed data for the **acrylic
  cantilever beam** experiments.  
  This archive includes:
  - time-domain measurement data, and  
  - the postprocessing code used to obtain the reported amplitude-frequency curves.

- **`Experiment_part_2.zip`**  
  Experimental data for the **aluminum alloy beam** experiments.  
  This archive contains the measurement data.

## Usage

1. Download the relevant ZIP archive(s) to your local machine.
2. Extract the contents to a directory of your choice.
3. Open the scripts in MATLAB and follow any in-file comments
   or instructions to reproduce the results.
